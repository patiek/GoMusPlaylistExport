2. Drag & Drop the generated m3u playlist file from Basic Usage steps above into Soundiiz.
3. Soundiiz will process your file and prompt you to select the services you connected in step 1 as the destination of your playlist.

#### Import using Ivy
1. Perform the steps under Basic Usage.
2. Use [Ivy](http://www.ivyishere.org/) to create a playlist file for Spotify from the playlist.txt file using the Copy/Paste functionality of Ivy to copy the text from the playlist.txt file.

## Options
The javascript takes two arguments which you will find on the last line:
#### maxTime 
##### default: -1
This is the time in seconds that the script waits for you to scroll the playlist before downloading the file. 
A -1 value indicates to wait until on new songs have been found for 10 seconds.
#### format
##### default: prompt
This is the format the script will download the file as. Supports 'prompt', 'm3u', 'ivy' and 'csv'. The 'prompt' value will generate an in-page dialog asking your to specify. 
If you need a custom format, you should download as a CSV and then open with spreadsheet software such as Excel or Google Docs.
